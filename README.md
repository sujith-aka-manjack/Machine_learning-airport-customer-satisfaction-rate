# Machine_learning-airport-customer-satisfaction-rate


effective Machine Learning Model for predicting customer satisfaction for an Airport Dataset with 37 features and 3502 instances. Dimension reduction technique is used to remove bias, which then passed through different models to get prediction.

An Airport customer satisfaction dataset with the 3502 datapoints and 37 features are used to predict the customer satisfaction rate using a machine learning model. The model is designed using Orange and accuracy tested using learning curve implimented using MATLAB. Initial Data conditioning performed with MATLAB. Refer to the codes for more details
